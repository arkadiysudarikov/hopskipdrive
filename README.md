# HopSkipDrive Drivers API


<img width="257" alt="HopSkipDrive" src="https://github.com/arkadiysudarikov/hopskipdrive/assets/382532/8f0304d0-23cc-4aea-b3d4-1da00d5e9ebd">

HopSkipDrive API for drivers. 

## Description

```
Unlike many other rideshares, HopSkipDrive is a scheduled ride service and not an on-demand ride service.
In our app for drivers, we show them a list of upcoming rides and they can pick the ones they want.
Our goal is to show them the best rides for each driver first, so to that end we have an internal scoring system.
In this exercise you will be implementing a slimmed down version of it
```

## Definitions

The **driving distance** between two addresses is the distance in miles that it would take to drive a reasonably
efficient route between them. It is not the straight line distance. It can be calculated by using a routing service

The **driving duration** between two addresses is the amount of time in hours it would take to drive the driving distance under realistic driving conditions. It can be calculated by using a routing service

The **commute distance** for a ride is the driving distance from the driverâ€™s home address to the start of the ride, in miles

The **commute duration** for a ride is the amount of time it is expected to take to drive the commute distance, in hours.

The **ride distance** for a ride is the driving distance from the start address of the ride to the destination address, in miles

The **ride duration** for a ride is the amount of time it is expected to take to drive the ride distance, in hours

The **ride earnings** is how much the driver earns by driving the ride. It takes into account both the amount of time the ride is expected to take and the distance. 

For the purposes of this exercise, it is calculated as: $12 + $1.50 per mile beyond 5 miles + (**ride duration**) * $0.70 per minute beyond 15 minutes

## Prompt 

```
The primary goal of this exercise is for you to demonstrate how you think about testing,
readability, and structuring a Rails application. We are also evaluating your ability to
understand and implement requirements.
```

## Specification

 - [x] Create a Rails 7 application, using Ruby 3+

 - [x] Include the following entities:

   - [x] Ride
     - [x] Has an id, a start address and a destination address. You may end up adding additional information
   - [x] Driver
     - [x] Has an id and a home address

 - [x] Build a RESTful API endpoint that returns a paginated JSON list of rides in descending score order for a given driver

 - [x] Please write up API documentation for this endpoint in MarkDown or alternative

 - [x] Calculate the score of a ride in $ per hour as: (**ride earnings**) / (**commute duration** + **ride duration**). Higher is better

 - [x] Google Maps is expensive. Consider how you can reduce duplicate API calls

 - [x] Include RSpec tests

## Features

- Implements the upcoming rides endpoint to be used by the driver's app. 


## Design Decisions



UUID for IDs 

Address table holds addresses for drivers and rides
 Address is a string that is valid for Google Directions API 
  Location ID 
   Google Place ID

   Similar addresses that share a location ID (potentially stored in a long-lived, distributed Solid Cache) can be used by both Driver and Ride and used in the API call to get commute and ride distance and duration. 

   



Rails Credentials 



Skinny controller, fat module. 

Client Class 


RSwag to provide OpenAPI UI


Pagy for pagination 
 Add data to headers 

 

## Gems for calling APIs

Faraday / excon / HTTP clients / etc. 


## Technologies Used

- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- OpenAPI
